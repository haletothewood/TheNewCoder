# The New Coder
This is the repo for https://thenewcoder.netlify.com

A website with nuggets of knowledge gleaned by coders, engineers and developers in their first year on the job.

## üí°Inspiration 

The idea for this came whilst reading the excellent book [97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Things-Every-Programmer-Should-Know/dp/0596809484). I felt that whilst an excellent collection of stories, by an exceptional cast of people, it often lacked a realness and immediacy that I was feeling as I blaze my way through my first few months in the industry. That's not to say I won't be revisiting the book again and again as I slowly begin to resinate with more of the overarching concepts. Till then I made this. I wanted to hear for myself how other new coders were feeling, what stories they hold and give them a super easy platform to share so that others may benefit. 

And so...
