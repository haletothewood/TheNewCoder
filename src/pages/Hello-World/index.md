This is how it's supposed to start right, with a "Hello World"? At least that's the lesson I learned whilst reading the book that inspired this project '97 things every programmer should know'.

The New Coder is my effort to create a resource for those who have already found themselves in the tech industry but are still wanting to learn from their peers and maybe share their experiences so that we may all continue to improve and connect.

I think the web is saturated with 'Learn to code' material and there are some wonderful resources for those taking their first steps into coding or levelling up with new tech but I've struggled to find as much for actually being a coder <sup>*</sup>. The daily grind, how to navigate the office politics, learning to speak up during retrospectives, debugging live code when the app is on fire. The things then don't teach you because they you'd run a mile. 

I'm also interested in all the little things you pick up along the way that make such a huge difference to your daily life as a coder. For example learning Resharper was a must early on as I work in C#, for others, learning intellisense or shortkeys make no sense (you see what I did there). That's a boring statement, not a story. You won't remember it in 5 minutes. 

But...if I told you that the reason I know this to be true is because my mentor at work would keep a tally of the times I used my mouse to navigate to a base type or member implementation instead of `ctrl + F12` or any other shortcut I failed to use. Then, at the end of my probabtion, and after he had totted up the total average time I'd wasted each day, showed me that I had lost a potential afternoon of productivity or beer time!

Well that's a little more interesting, not a lot, but a little. You see I'm not much of a writer but I love to read stories. That's why I need your help. Remember at the start I said I wanted this to be a resource, well that's true, but I can't create it all by myself, that would be one snoozefest let me tell you. 

I personally know of more than a few new coders whose stories I would love to hear and if they know a few that could share their stories and they knew a few, we could have the beginnings of a joke about recursion and more importantly the beginnings of a great collection of real stories from real coders making their first waves in tech. 

If you don't wish to contrubute by sharing your story I'd be grateful if you can help spread the word by sharing on social media where you can.

Yours in coding,
